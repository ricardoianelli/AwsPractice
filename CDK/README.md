## 📚 About 📚
Code needed to create a bucket using CDK (and CloudFormation under the hood).

What is does is that this C# code generates a JSON template that CloudFormation understands, and using Node.Js it somehow get's uploaded there. I still don't understand exactly all the underlying process, but given the timebox I have, I had to postpone that deep dive adventure.
