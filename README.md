## 📚 About 📚

In my Master's Degree I had an 1 month course called Cloud Computing, where I've learned about the basics of Cloud and Amazon Web Services. Since it's been a great course and I really
want to keep practicing and learning more about that, I've decided to version some of my works in here mainly so that I can always come back and check how I did something, but also so that 
I may be able to help someone who also wants to do the same. With time I will be posting new materials, but feel free to contribute at any time, I want to learn as much as I can!

### Contents so far:
- [API Gateway + Cognito + Lambda + DynamoDB](https://github.com/ricardoianelli/AwsPractice/blob/main/CourseLambda/README.md)
